The purpose of this document is to derive the Kalman Filter algorithm from a PGM perspective. It is shown that when the Kalman Filter is represented as a Junction Tree the standard algorithm is hiding in plain sight and just needs to be extracted from the results of the Integral-Sum message passing algorithm.
