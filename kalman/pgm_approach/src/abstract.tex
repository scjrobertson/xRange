\section*{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to derive the Kalman Filter algorithm from a PGM perspective. It is shown that when Kalman Filter is represented as a Junction Tree, the algorithm is hiding in plain sight and just need to extracted from the Integral-Sum message passing computation.

I had grand designs on creating an eloquent document which would concisely explain everything relevant, but I sort of got bored halfway through and it petered out. Look at Figures~\ref{figure:bayes_net} and~\ref{figure:junction_tree}, then skip to Section~\ref{chapter:filtering_equations}, everything else here is a bizarre mix of boring and irritating.
